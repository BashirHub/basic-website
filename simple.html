te what a page looks like, let's create a basic HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <style>
    .p1{color: aqua;}
    .l1{background-color: blueviolet;}
    .l1{font-size: larger;}
  </style>
  <h1>This is a first level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into red color</h1>
  <h2>This is a second level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into blue color</h2>
  <h3>This is a third level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into green color</h3>
  <p>This is a <em>paragragh</em> As you can see, I placed an empahisis on the word "paragraph". Now, I will change also
    the background color of the word "paragraph" to black, and its text color  to green, all with just CSS.</p>
  <p class="p1">The main essence of this tutorial is to:</p>
    <ul>
       <li class="l1">Show you how to format a web document with HTML</li>
       <li class="l1">Show you how to design a web page with CSS</li>
       <li class="l1">Show you how to program a web document with JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

  <p class="p1">Next, I am going to add the following two numbers and display the result, all with JavaScript<p/>
    <p class="p1">First number:<span id= "firstNum">2</span> <br></p>
    <p class="p1">Second number: <span id= "secondNum">7</span> </p>
    <p>Therefore, the sum of the two of those numbers is: <span id= "answer">(placeholder for the answer)</span></p>
    <input type="button" id="sumButton" value="Click to add!">
</body>
</html>
